# TrafficScript Examples for the Brocade Steelapp

Example TrafficScript scripts for the Brocade Steelapp load balancer. 

The load balancer has gone under many different names, such as stingray, zeus and zxtm. 

The TrafficManager or Zeus or ZXTM or Stingray or SteelApp was formerly sold by Riverbed until 2014. 

Please feel free to use the TrafficScript examples here, there is a lack of resource for this scripting language.

To install the rules, go to catalogues -> rules -> create new rule + name and paste the script. 

To apply a script, you need to select a virtual server in services and select the appropriate rules in the rules section. 

Brocade/Riverbed provide a traffic script reference guide which is a good resource but it does have some errors. 

Brocade/Riverbed provide the traffic manager application available for free on their support section, but it can only be used for development.

The F5 equivalent of these traffic script rules are known as iRules - which provide similar functionality on the BIG-IP local traffic manager. 

If you spot any bugs or want to provide changes/fixes, please commit/message me.
